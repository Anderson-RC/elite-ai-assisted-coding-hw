# Elite AI Assisted Coding Homework

We're building a SaaS app to help writers outline short stories using Orson Scott Card's "Mice Quotient" structure.

## Homework Structure

Each assignment has a demo and start/end points. Replicate the demo or adjust difficulty by:

- Change the UI/styling (easier)
- Switch frameworks—Next.js, Django, Flask (moderate)
- Use different narrative structures (harder)
- Build your own app applying these techniques (hardest)
- Any other idea or deviation you have!

## Why Air?

Air is a FastAPI-based web framework by Danny and Audrey Roy-Greenfeld.

Why I'm using it:
1. Built on FastAPI—proven foundation
2. New—minimal training data. You'll work with context, not memorization
3. I like it. Use what works for you.  If Air doesn't, do all the assignments in your framework of choice.

## Why Something New?

Real work involves internal libraries, private repos, and code that's not in training data. 

Learning with tools that don't have significant representation in the training data builds those skills.
