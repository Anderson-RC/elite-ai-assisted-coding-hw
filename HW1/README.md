## The Assignment

Create a requirement document that describes in detail what you want to build and then use AI to build it. 

This assignment can be scaled in difficulty based on your abilities and experience.  I recommend starting with #1, and progressing as far as you'd like to:

Here's some ideas:

**Level 1**
 Use the context I created, read it, and modify something about the app I created.  Here's some ideas:
    - UI: Make it mobile friendly
    - UI: Allow for re-ordering of the cards within sections.  Arrows or drag and drop
    - UI: Improve the aesthetics of the AI Generated outline.
    - Database: Use an ORM to improve the database management, and set up migrations
    - Feature: Add a create outline with AI feature

**Level 2**

Read the context carefully to understand it, then re-create the context and make this specic app.  I recommend taking notes of the kinds of things you want to include in yours (such as tech stack) while reading my context!  Then, make a new directory and do it without looking at the specific context, just referencing your notes.  You can also rebuild it in the framework of your choosing.

**Level 3**

Do this process for your own app or project!
